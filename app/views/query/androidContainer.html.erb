<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
  Container program for Android can be <a href="/zipped_client/android_client/VisualRESTClient.apk">downloaded</a>.
  The program has been tested on <b>Samsung Galaxy Nexus</b>.
  After the program is installed on your device and started, you will see the main window.
</p>

<p>
  Go to 'VisualREST account settings' and insert your VisualREST username & password and press save.
</p>

<p>
  When you return to the main window, you will see that the hourglass has 
  changed to notify you that the username/password combination is correct.
</p>

<p>
  Next go to 'Device settings' and give a name for your device.
</p>

<p>
  Press 'register this device as a container'.
</p>

<p>
  When you return to main menu, you will notice that your device is 
  successfully registered and the three buttons below are also enabled.
</p>

<p>
  You can turn on 'automatic metadata upload', meaning that metadata of all new photos taken with the camera 
  are automatically uploaded to the VisualREST server.
  When the XMPP service is turned on the server can send requests to your device, such as upload thumbnails
  or essence of content.
</p>

<p>
  You can also manually upload content to VisualREST. In the photo gallery you will notice the possibility to
  upload metadata of a photo to VisualREST (the actual essence of the photo is not sent until explicitly requested with XMPP).
  Also you can upload the whole photo to VisualREST (the photo is stored on a virtual container called 'android_container').
